The book is available as a free pdf download at https://www.uclpress.co.uk/products/123963 In his famous essay, Chomsky wrote: \u2018It is the responsibility of intellectuals to speak the truth and to expose lies. This, at least, may seem enough of a truism to pass over without comment.\u2019 One might ask what the source of this responsibility (henceforth RI) is. Chomsky notes that in W estern democracies, where there is \u2018political liberty, \u2026 access to information and freedom of expression\u2019 a \u2018privileged minority\u2019 (whom he refers to as \u2018intellectuals\u2019) also have the leisure, the faciliti es, and the training to seek the truth lying hidden behind the veil of distortion and misrepresentation, ideology and class interest, through which the events of current history are presented to us. They therefore have responsibilities that go beyond those of others. Agreeing with this, one might note that RI seems to presuppose that exposing political truths has a certain kind of instrumental value, namely that it will tend to make the world a better place by changing people\u2019 s political views. 1 In fact, Chomsky\u2019 s position on this question is more nuanced. In an interview he said \u2018I don\u2019t have faith that the truth will prevail if it becomes known, but we have no a lternative to \n \n \n proceeding on that assumption\u2019, and he has often endorsed Gramsci\u2019 s \u2018optimism of the will\u2019 as a necessary corollary to pessimism of the intellect. 2 I suggest that intellectuals and other privileged individuals have the responsibility not only to tell the truth and expose lies but to do so in ways that \u2013 in their best judgement \u2013 are most likely to be understood and to be ef fective. This is a fairly direct consequence of another claim that Chomsky has made many times: that people are responsible for the foreseeable consequences of their actions. He calls this a truism, too, with some justification. But why does the issue of effectiveness even arise? Isn\u2019t it enough simply to get the truth out in some form or other? Perhaps no one has ever held such a naive view; in any case, recent findings in psychology and political science make the challenges it faces more obvious and specific. They suggest that the truth does not necessarily influence political behaviour even when it is available, and that exposure to the truth may entrench rather than overthrow erroneous opinions. There is strong evidence th at voting is not driven primarily by evaluation of the policies on offer. Recently, the political scientists Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels have argued that voting is not well explained as selection of a party with policies that match the voter \u2019s preferences, nor as rewarding or punishing incumbents for their ac tions. 3 Evid ence includes the startling fact that votes are strongly affected by natural events. If Achen and Bartels are right, then there is a significant disconnection between widely available information and one of the central ways that citizens exert political power, and it is natural to suppose that the story is similar for \n \n other political behaviour besides voting. The challenge to RI from th is research is that telling the truth and exposing lies may not make much difference. A second problem is indicated by research on motivated reasoning and the \u2018backfire effect\u2019. Facts tha t contradict political beliefs or discredit voters\u2019 preferred electoral candidates tend to reinforce rather than dispel those beliefs and allegiances. 4 We have a strong tendency to treat such facts with suspicion, while uncritically welcoming evidence that confirms our current views. Clearly, the challenge to RI posed by this work is that telling the truth may be counterproductive and damaging. In what follows, I first set out these research findings in a bit more detail, then consider how troubling these results \u2013 if real and robust \u2013are for RI. In my discussion, I briefly show that Achen and Bartels\u2019 results are highly congruent with Chomsky\u2019 s views on the functioning of education systems, the mass media and representative democracy in the US and other modern democracies. It is plausible that deepening democracy so that it more closely matches the popular ideal will require considerable changes to education, the media and the democratic system itself. If the backfire effect is dominant then RI will often be overridden by a responsibility to avoid harm. But the findings about the backfire effect need to be weighed up against other evidence that telling the truth can change opinions in positive ways. The problematic findings Democracy for Realists \n \n In their recen t book, Achen and Bartels claim that there is a dom inant folk theory or popular ideal of democracy, 5 which can be summarised in this way: Ordinary people have preferences about what their government should do. They choose leaders who will do those things, or they enact their preferences directly in referendums. In either case, what the majority wants becomes government policy. 6 Summarising a great deal of evidence, they argue that this theory is wrong: The populist ideal of electoral democracy, for all its elegance and attractiveness, is largely irrelevant in practice, leaving elected officials mostly free to pursue their own notions of the public good or to respond to party and interest group pressures. 7 A wealth of evidence suggests that votes are not cast on the basis of voters\u2019 policy preferences, and unsurprisingly, therefore, there is often a poor match between those preferences and the policies of the parties voted for. 8 Achen and Bartels also argue that electoral choices do not support the retrospective voting hypothesis: that voters assess the performance of elected representatives and officials and punish or reward them accordingly at subsequent elections. They identify two reasons. First, voters are not good at distinguishing the effects caused by government policies from other effects. Achen and Bartels demonstrate this by \n \n showing that voters punish politicians for outcomes that are clearly not under the ir control, including natural events such as shark attacks, droughts and floods. Secondly, voters are not very good at keeping track of changes, even those that impact upon their own welfare. Achen and Bartels show that while voters do vote on the basis of income growth, there is a recency bias: we tend to focus on income growth in the months im mediately prior to the election, neglecting the overall record of the government. They also argue that so-called \u2018direct democracy\u2019, where voters vote on issues rather than for representatives, does not brighten the picture, because there is evidence that the results of such referendums and ballot initiatives reflect campaign spending by the wealthy more than the preferenc es of voters. In practice, Achen and Bartels argue \u2013 agreeing with work by David Broder \u2013 that the result of increased use of direct votes on issues, in the US at least, has largely been to empower the wealthy and well- organised \u2018millionaires and interest groups that use their wealth to achieve their own policy goals\u2019. 9 The true pi cture, Achen and Bartels argue, is that most voters pay little attention to politics, and at elections their choices depend largely on recent developments in the economy and on political group loyalties that are typically held from childhood. 10 The backfire effect A number of studies have found that evidence against a political or social belief may serve to strengthen that belief, and that negative information about a political \n \n candidate may increase the support she receives from those who already support her. Although these findings are striking, they should perhaps not be very surprising, given that ther e is a wealth of evidence from work over several decades in psychology and economics that human reasoning is prone to a wide variety of biases. W e are very far from dispassionate, logical reasoners: our reasoning is often motivated, that is, slanted by our preconceptions and towards conclusions that we would prefer to be true, and much of it is performed by efficient but flawed heuristics rather than processes that respect laws of logic and statistical inference. What is more, we are not very reliable reporters of the way we reason. Introspection \u2013 that is, thinking about how one thinks \u2013 is not in general an ac curate source of information. 11 The work discussed in this section extends this picture to political science. Psychologists Kari Edwards and Edward Smith have shown a disconfirmation bias in reasoning about political and social issues: people examine arguments for longer on average if they clash with a belief that they hold, and such arguments are therefore judged weaker on average than those which are compatible with prior beliefs. They also showed that this bias is greater when the belief that clashes with the argument is held with emotional conviction. 12 In a series of papers, political scientists Milton Lodge and Charles Taber find similar effects in our processing of information rela ting to issues such as gun control and affirmative action. The typical reaction to an argument against a prior belief or commitment is to gene rate counterarguments, whereas arguments that support prior beliefs are accepted uncritically. 13 This tendency to generate counterarguments has a strikingly counterintuitive result: negative information can lead to a strengthening, rather than a weakening, of the \n \n initial belief. 14 This is the \u2018backfire effect\u2019, a term coined by Brendan Nyhan and Jason Reifler. 15 In their study, corrections of erroneous beliefs (e.g. that Iraq poss essed weapons of mass destruction immediately before the US\u2013UK invasion of 2003) led to reinforcement of the false belief. Similar results emerge from work on (simulated) choice of political candidates. A study conduct ed by David Redlawsk found that voters took longer to process information that showed in a bad light a candidate whom the voter had already evaluated positively and information that showed in a good light a candidate already evaluated negatively, compared with information that fitted their expectations. 16 The backfire effect exists here too: negative information about a positively evaluated candidate tended to make that candidate more positively evaluated, not less. In a later paper, Redlawsk and his co- authors Andrew Civettini and Karen Emmerson suggest an explanation: voters committed to a candidate may be motivated to discount incongruent information; they may mentally ar gue against it, bolstering their existing evaluation by recalling all the good things about a liked candidate even in the face of something negative. 17 T aken together, this research suggests that we are very far from ideally rational, disinterested observers of the scene, updating our beliefs as warranted by new evidence. Under certain circumstances, we employ reasoning as a defence mechanism to bolster our prior convictions and choices against inconvenient truths. 18 \n \n Discussion How worried should a supporter of the responsibility of intellectuals be? The Democracy for Realists findings are disturbing, but perhaps not as surprising for those on the left as they have been for some liberals and political scientists, since left- wingers of various persuasions have long argued that many people vote against their own interests (back at least to Engels\u2019 invoc ation of \u2018false consciousness\u2019). 19 In addition, Achen and Bartels do not fully specify the mechanisms behind the effects they have discovered, leaving scope for supporters of RI to argue that part of the problem is that important truths are insufficiently well known and that lies go unchallenged. In that case, truth-telling by intellectuals could make a difference to how people vote. What is more, political change does not come about only, or even mainly, through choices at elections, and supporters of RI can argue that the responsibility to tell the truth is partly due to the effect a better-informed public may have in other ways, such as by improving the political culture. The clash between the backfire effect and RI is harder to set aside. Revealing the truth about an issue, political party or candidate may have the opposite result to the one intended, entrenching opinions rather than changing th em. To the extent that RI is motivated or justified by the expectation that exposing political truths will cause positive change, this is a fundamental challenge to the view. H appily, although the backfire effect is robust, there is convergent evidence that information can affect political views in non-perverse ways. \n \n Bounded rationality Both sets of findings have been connected with the fact that human rationality is bounded in various ways: by time, attention span, processing power and the competing demands of life. 20 We are finite beings, with only limited time and resources, and many other things to do besides keeping abre ast of the activities of our governments; so, as Achen and Bartels write, In the welter of political claims and counterclaims, most people simply lack the time and relevant experience to sort out difficult truths from appealing dreams. That is no less true for Ivy League and Oxbridge dons than it is for average citizens. 21 Given that Achen and Bartels\u2019 work does not specify in great detail the mechanisms that are responsible for their results, 22 a proponent of RI could argue that part of the problem is that those who could speak out do not do so, and this increases the amounts of time and attention required to get at the truth by sifting through the lies and evasions of politicians, columnists and the like. As Chomsky noted in his essay: The facts [about the US assault on V ietnam] are known to all who care to know. The press, foreign and domestic, has presented documentation to refute each falsehood as it appe ars. But the power of the government\u2019 s propaganda apparatus is such that the citizen who \n \n does not undertake a research project on the subject can hardly hope to confront government pronouncements with fact. This is work that those with research skills and free time can usefully do, thus lowering t he barriers somewhat for those who do not, although they are left, unavoidably, with the second-order research projects of deciding what to read and whether to believe it. Finding out about and critically reading the work of (e.g.) Patrick Cockburn and Tanya Reinhart on western Asia or Dean Baker and Ha-Joon Chang on economics takes considerable time and effort, but doing the work for oneself would take several lifetimes. 23 The role of the media Most adults get most of their information about politics and current affairs through the mass media. Obviously relevant, therefore, is Chomsky\u2019s work with Edward Herman on the ways that, in the formally free mass media in democratic societies, inconvenient facts are downplayed and debate is bounded by certain presuppositions that are neither questioned nor stated. 24 This work is highly congruent with Achen and Bartels\u2019 work; indeed it can be seen as suggesting mechanisms that help to cause the results they see: By manufacturing consent, you can overcome the fact that formally a lot of people have the right to vote. We can make i t irrelevant because we can manufacture consent and make sure that their choices and \n \n attitudes will be structured in such a way th at they will always do what we tell them, even if they have a formal way to participate. 25 Assuming this is correct, the impact on RI is not obvious. Knowing that certain truths are off limits for the mass media arguably makes it more imperative for those who can to speak out. But this respons ibility comes with a heavy dose of realism about getting views that are outside of the mainstream heard and understood. The role of a good education There are a number of other similarities between the views of Chomsky and Achen and Bartels. Chomsky has frequently made the claim that among the most thoroughly indoctrinated in modern democracies are the \u2018well-educated\u2019, that is, those who have spent longer than average in formal education, especially those who have attended elite institutions: I f you\u2019ve gone to the best schools . .. you just have instilled into you the understanding that there are certain things that [it] wouldn\u2019t do to say [a]nd, it wouldn\u2019t even do to think. 26 In a similar vein, Achen and Bartels write that: W ell-informed citizens[\u2019]... well-organized \u2018ideological\u2019 thinking often turns out to be just a rather mechanical reflection of what their favorite group and party leaders have instructed them to think. 27 \n \n Obviously the picture is complicated by the fact that elite education is also conducive to the possession of s kills that are needed for independent research and to the leisure required to put them to use, as Chomsky pointed out in \u2018The Res ponsibility of Intellectuals\u2019. The role of the democratic system W e\u2019ve seen that Chomsky suggests that the media and the education s ystem structure our attitudes. This could explain some part of Achen and Bartels\u2019 results. But, as discussed above, those results also show that people vote against their own preferences. Their explanation is that voting behaviour is better explained by the social group or groups to which a voter belongs. 28 Another mechanism that very plausibly explains some of the mismatches between voter preferences and policy choices is the role of campaign finance. Thomas Ferguson\u2019 s investment theory of party competition, often cited by Chomsky, postulates that the need to ra ise campaign finance (\u2018the campaign cost condition\u2019) reduces party politics to \u2018competition between blocs of major investors\u2019. 29 This means that voters are offered a choice between organisations that repre sent and will implement the preferred policies of certain areas of business, none of which is likely to match closely the preferences of ordinary voters. As Chomsky has pointed out, for a long time universal healthcare was the preference of the majority of voters in the US, but neither major party offered it. \n \n It would seem that if one takes democracy seriously, one should work towards a system that is resilient against such distortions. Chomsky\u2019 s vision here is of a bottom- up, citizen-led democracy: In a democratic system, what would happen [in the New Hampshire primary] is that the people in New Hampshire would get together in whatever organizations they have: town meetings, churches, unions, and work out what they want policy to be. Then, if some candidate wants to appeal to them, he could ask to be invited, and they would invite him to New Hampshire and tell him what they want. And, if they could get a commitment from him that they could believe in, they might decide to vote for him. That would be a democratic society. 30 Assuming that Achen and Bartels are right, even if important truths become widely known in currently existing democracies, it is entirely possible that there will be little effect on how people vote. That is certainly chastening for supporters of RI, but in itself it is not enough to remove the responsibility, since it does not prove that telling the truth will not have an impact within the present system, and it shows little or nothing about whether it will aid in moving towards a more democratic society. The backfire effect redux If the backfire effect were always operative and dominan t, then a key motivation for telling the truth and exposing lies would disappear, since telling the truth would generally be counterproductive. 31 But a moment\u2019s thought establishes that this cannot \n \n be right. People do change their minds, and at least some of the time when they do so it is because they have been persuaded by evidence against their prior belief. In experimental work investigating the backfire ef fect, Redlawsk, Civettini and Emmerson found that the re is a \u2018tipping point\u2019 beyond whic h further negative evidence has a negative effect rat her than a reinforcing one. 32 As they s ay, this indicates that \u2018voters are not immune to disconfirming information after all, even when initially acting as motivated reasoners\u2019. 33 Other research shows tha t exposure to modest amounts of information can shift opinions considerably and th at it has some e ffect on policy preferences. One strand of this research has focussed on attitudes to immigration. In western countries, most people significantly overestimate the number of immigrants in their country, hold other inaccurate opinions about immigrants and would like immigration reduced. A large study carried out across 13 countries found that telling participants the correct percentage of immigrants in their country made it less likely that they would say that there are too many. In two studies in which participants were told five pieces of information about immigrants, this improved their attitudes toward immigrants. This information did not significantly chang e policy preferences on average, but it did make self-identified right-wingers and Republicans more likely to support pro- immigration policies, the opposite to what one might expect if the backfire effect were operative. 34 Similarly, a recent study carried out by Giovanni Facchin i, Yotam Margalit and Hiroyuki Nakata in Japan \u2013 a country with very few immigrants and broad political opposition to immigration \u2013 found that hostility to increased \n \n immigration was considerably decreased by the presentation of information about potential social and economic benefits. 35 It is clear, therefore, that it can be effective to expose people to information that tends to undermine their beliefs. Obviously, it would be useful to know more about when telling the truth is effective and when it is counterproduc tive. It is very plausible that the way that information is present ed matters, in ways tha t we still know too little about. The research mentioned above on heuristics and biases is obviously relevant. It may also matter whether information is openly stated, or implied, or somehow presupposed. Such questions are the province of pragmatics, the area of linguistics which studies how we communicate with each other in context. 36 There is also a growing literature on the role of the sal ience of social group membership in receptiveness to information and argumentation. 37 As Alana Conner puts it: \u2018One of the things we know from social psychology is when people feel threatened, they can\u2019t change, they can\u2019t listen.\u2019 38 In any case, the respons ibility to tell the truth and expose lies remains, and is accompanied by a responsibility to do so effectively, which implies a further responsibility to keep abreast of research of the type discussed here as it develops. \n \n 1. Of course, telling the truth may be the right thing for intellectuals and others to do for other reasons, for example a Kantian or Christian prohibition on lies, or various possible instrumental roles of truth-telling other than informing people\u2019s first-order political behaviour (e.g. it might promote trust in experts, and that might be a good). I proceed on the assumption that for Chomsky the effect of truth-telling on people\u2019 s political views and therefore behaviour is a central reason for RI. 2.

These findings are congruent with (although logically independent from) Mercier and Sperber\u2019s claim that the evolutionary function of the ability to reason is not to improve knowledge and make better decisions, but to help us to persuade others and to protect us against persuasion. However, to the extent that the results are problematic for RI, that is so regardless of any evolutionary backstory. The issue is what people do when presented with the truth, not why they do it.

The experimental pragmatics literature has extensively investigated the ways in which distinct contextual factors affect the computation of scalar inferences, whose most studied example is the one that allows \u201cSome X-ed\u201d to mean Not all X-ed. Recent studies from Bonnefon et al. (2009, 2011) investigate the effect of politeness on the interpretation of scalar utterances. They argue that when the scalar utterance is face-threatening (\u201cSome people hated your speech\u201d) (i) the scalar inference is less likely to be derived, and (ii) the semantic interpretation of \u201csome\u201d (at least some) is arrived at slowly and effortfully. This paper re-evaluates the role of politeness in the computation of scalar inferences by drawing on the distinction between \u201ccomprehension\u201d and \u201cepistemic assessment\u201d of communicated information. In two experiments, we test the hypothesis that, in these face-threatening contexts, scalar inferences are largely derived but are less likely to be accepted as true. In line with our predictions, we find that slowdowns in the face-threatening condition are attributable to longer reaction times at the (latter) epistemic assessment stage, but not at the comprehension stage. Chris Knight Giovanni Facchini Yotam Margalit Hiroyuki Nakata Is opposition to immigration deeply entrenched or is it open to updating in the face of new information? We explore this question by examining how attitudes of native citizens shift following exposure to information that points to potential upsides of immigration. We do so using a large-scale randomized experiment embedded in a text-comprehension study administered in Japan. As part of the study, participants were subtly presented with information on social and economic problems that immigration could help address (e.g., growing elderly population that requires care, labor shortage in certain sectors). Depending on the treatment, information exposure increased support for a more open immigration policy and motivated pro-immigration political action. Notably, effects persisted 10-12 days after the intervention. The results suggest that information campaigns can lessen public opposition to immigration. Commitment plays a crucial role in the stabilization of communication. While commitment increases the acceptance of the message communicated, it comes with a price: the greater the commitment, the greater the cost (direct or reputational) the speakers incur if the message is found unreliable (Vullioud et al., 2017). This opens up the question of which linguistic cues hearers deploy in order to infer speaker commitment in communication. We present a series of empirical studies to test the hypothesis that distinct meaning-relations e saying, presupposing and implicating e act as pragmatic cues of speaker commitment. Our results demonstrate that, after a message p is found to be false, speakers incur different reputational costs as a function of whether p had been explicitly stated, presupposed, or implicated. All else being equal, participants are significantly more likely to selectively trust the speaker who implicated p than the speaker who asserted or presupposed p. These results provide the first empirical evidence that commitment is modulated by different meaning-relations, and shed a new light on the strategic advantages of implicit communication. Speakers can decrease the reputational damages they incur by conveying unreliable messages when these are implicitly communicated.",

All over India, it was women who embraced the challenge of overcoming numerous social taboos and aesthetic handicaps that came along with this nascent technology. Women who took the plunge and recorded largely belonged to the courtesan community, called _tawaifs_ and _devadasis_, in North and South India, respectively. Recording brought with it great fame, brand recognition, freedom from exploitative patrons, and monetary benefits to the women singers. They were to become pioneers of the music industry in the Indian sub-continent. However, despite the pioneering role played by these women, their stories have largely been forgotten. Contemporaneous with the courtesan women adapting to recording technology was the anti-nautch campaign that sought to abolish these women from the performing space and brand them as common prostitutes. A vigorous renaissance and arts revival movement followed, leading to the creation of a new classical paradigm in both North Indian (Hindustani) and South Indian (Carnatic) classical music. This resulted in the standardization, universalization, and institutionalization of Indian classical music. This newly created classical paradigm impacted future recordings of The Gramophone Company in terms of a shift in genres and styles. Vikram Sampath sheds light on the role and impact of The Gramophone Company\u2019s early recording expeditions on Indian classical music by examining the phenomenon through a sociocultural, historical and musical lens.

The book is available as a free pdf download at https://www.uclpress.co.uk/products/123963 In his famous essay, Chomsky wrote: \u2018It is the responsibility of intellectuals to speak the truth and to expose lies. This, at least, may seem enough of a truism to pass over without comment.\u2019 One might ask what the source of this responsibility (henceforth RI) is. Chomsky notes that in W estern democracies, where there is \u2018political liberty, \u2026 access to information and freedom of expression\u2019 a \u2018privileged minority\u2019 (whom he refers to as \u2018intellectuals\u2019) also have the leisure, the faciliti es, and the training to seek the truth lying hidden behind the veil of distortion and misrepresentation, ideology and class interest, through which the events of current history are presented to us. They therefore have responsibilities that go beyond those of others. Agreeing with this, one might note that RI seems to presuppose that exposing political truths has a certain kind of instrumental value, namely that it will tend to make the world a better place by changing people\u2019 s political views. 1 In fact, Chomsky\u2019 s position on this question is more nuanced. In an interview he said \u2018I don\u2019t have faith that the truth will prevail if it becomes known, but we have no a lternative to \n \n \n proceeding on that assumption\u2019, and he has often endorsed Gramsci\u2019 s \u2018optimism of the will\u2019 as a necessary corollary to pessimism of the intellect. 2 I suggest that intellectuals and other privileged individuals have the responsibility not only to tell the truth and expose lies but to do so in ways that \u2013 in their best judgement \u2013 are most likely to be understood and to be ef fective. This is a fairly direct consequence of another claim that Chomsky has made many times: that people are responsible for the foreseeable consequences of their actions. He calls this a truism, too, with some justification. But why does the issue of effectiveness even arise? Isn\u2019t it enough simply to get the truth out in some form or other? Perhaps no one has ever held such a naive view; in any case, recent findings in psychology and political science make the challenges it faces more obvious and specific. They suggest that the truth does not necessarily influence political behaviour even when it is available, and that exposure to the truth may entrench rather than overthrow erroneous opinions. There is strong evidence th at voting is not driven primarily by evaluation of the policies on offer. Recently, the political scientists Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels have argued that voting is not well explained as selection of a party with policies that match the voter \u2019s preferences, nor as rewarding or punishing incumbents for their ac tions. 3 Evid ence includes the startling fact that votes are strongly affected by natural events. If Achen and Bartels are right, then there is a significant disconnection between widely available information and one of the central ways that citizens exert political power, and it is natural to suppose that the story is similar for \n \n other political behaviour besides voting. The challenge to RI from th is research is that telling the truth and exposing lies may not make much difference. A second problem is indicated by research on motivated reasoning and the \u2018backfire effect\u2019. Facts tha t contradict political beliefs or discredit voters\u2019 preferred electoral candidates tend to reinforce rather than dispel those beliefs and allegiances. 4 We have a strong tendency to treat such facts with suspicion, while uncritically welcoming evidence that confirms our current views. Clearly, the challenge to RI posed by this work is that telling the truth may be counterproductive and damaging. In what follows, I first set out these research findings in a bit more detail, then consider how troubling these results \u2013 if real and robust \u2013are for RI. In my discussion, I briefly show that Achen and Bartels\u2019 results are highly congruent with Chomsky\u2019 s views on the functioning of education systems, the mass media and representative democracy in the US and other modern democracies. It is plausible that deepening democracy so that it more closely matches the popular ideal will require considerable changes to education, the media and the democratic system itself. If the backfire effect is dominant then RI will often be overridden by a responsibility to avoid harm. But the findings about the backfire effect need to be weighed up against other evidence that telling the truth can change opinions in positive ways. The problematic findings Democracy for Realists \n \n In their recen t book, Achen and Bartels claim that there is a dom inant folk theory or popular ideal of democracy, 5 which can be summarised in this way: Ordinary people have preferences about what their government should do. They choose leaders who will do those things, or they enact their preferences directly in referendums. In either case, what the majority wants becomes government policy. 6 Summarising a great deal of evidence, they argue that this theory is wrong: The populist ideal of electoral democracy, for all its elegance and attractiveness, is largely irrelevant in practice, leaving elected officials mostly free to pursue their own notions of the public good or to respond to party and interest group pressures. 7 A wealth of evidence suggests that votes are not cast on the basis of voters\u2019 policy preferences, and unsurprisingly, therefore, there is often a poor match between those preferences and the policies of the parties voted for. 8 Achen and Bartels also argue that electoral choices do not support the retrospective voting hypothesis: that voters assess the performance of elected representatives and officials and punish or reward them accordingly at subsequent elections. They identify two reasons. First, voters are not good at distinguishing the effects caused by government policies from other effects. Achen and Bartels demonstrate this by \n \n showing that voters punish politicians for outcomes that are clearly not under the ir control, including natural events such as shark attacks, droughts and floods. Secondly, voters are not very good at keeping track of changes, even those that impact upon their own welfare. Achen and Bartels show that while voters do vote on the basis of income growth, there is a recency bias: we tend to focus on income growth in the months im mediately prior to the election, neglecting the overall record of the government. They also argue that so-called \u2018direct democracy\u2019, where voters vote on issues rather than for representatives, does not brighten the picture, because there is evidence that the results of such referendums and ballot initiatives reflect campaign spending by the wealthy more than the preferenc es of voters. In practice, Achen and Bartels argue \u2013 agreeing with work by David Broder \u2013 that the result of increased use of direct votes on issues, in the US at least, has largely been to empower the wealthy and well- organised \u2018millionaires and interest groups that use their wealth to achieve their own policy goals\u2019. 9 The true pi cture, Achen and Bartels argue, is that most voters pay little attention to politics, and at elections their choices depend largely on recent developments in the economy and on political group loyalties that are typically held from childhood. 10 The backfire effect A number of studies have found that evidence against a political or social belief may serve to strengthen that belief, and that negative information about a political \n \n candidate may increase the support she receives from those who already support her. Although these findings are striking, they should perhaps not be very surprising, given that ther e is a wealth of evidence from work over several decades in psychology and economics that human reasoning is prone to a wide variety of biases. W e are very far from dispassionate, logical reasoners: our reasoning is often motivated, that is, slanted by our preconceptions and towards conclusions that we would prefer to be true, and much of it is performed by efficient but flawed heuristics rather than processes that respect laws of logic and statistical inference. What is more, we are not very reliable reporters of the way we reason. Introspection \u2013 that is, thinking about how one thinks \u2013 is not in general an ac curate source of information. 11 The work discussed in this section extends this picture to political science. Psychologists Kari Edwards and Edward Smith have shown a disconfirmation bias in reasoning about political and social issues: people examine arguments for longer on average if they clash with a belief that they hold, and such arguments are therefore judged weaker on average than those which are compatible with prior beliefs. They also showed that this bias is greater when the belief that clashes with the argument is held with emotional conviction. 12 In a series of papers, political scientists Milton Lodge and Charles Taber find similar effects in our processing of information rela ting to issues such as gun control and affirmative action. The typical reaction to an argument against a prior belief or commitment is to gene rate counterarguments, whereas arguments that support prior beliefs are accepted uncritically. 13 This tendency to generate counterarguments has a strikingly counterintuitive result: negative information can lead to a strengthening, rather than a weakening, of the \n \n initial belief. 14 This is the \u2018backfire effect\u2019, a term coined by Brendan Nyhan and Jason Reifler. 15 In their study, corrections of erroneous beliefs (e.g. that Iraq poss essed weapons of mass destruction immediately before the US\u2013UK invasion of 2003) led to reinforcement of the false belief. Similar results emerge from work on (simulated) choice of political candidates. A study conduct ed by David Redlawsk found that voters took longer to process information that showed in a bad light a candidate whom the voter had already evaluated positively and information that showed in a good light a candidate already evaluated negatively, compared with information that fitted their expectations. 16 The backfire effect exists here too: negative information about a positively evaluated candidate tended to make that candidate more positively evaluated, not less. In a later paper, Redlawsk and his co- authors Andrew Civettini and Karen Emmerson suggest an explanation: voters committed to a candidate may be motivated to discount incongruent information; they may mentally ar gue against it, bolstering their existing evaluation by recalling all the good things about a liked candidate even in the face of something negative. 17 T aken together, this research suggests that we are very far from ideally rational, disinterested observers of the scene, updating our beliefs as warranted by new evidence. Under certain circumstances, we employ reasoning as a defence mechanism to bolster our prior convictions and choices against inconvenient truths. 18 \n \n Discussion How worried should a supporter of the responsibility of intellectuals be? The Democracy for Realists findings are disturbing, but perhaps not as surprising for those on the left as they have been for some liberals and political scientists, since left- wingers of various persuasions have long argued that many people vote against their own interests (back at least to Engels\u2019 invoc ation of \u2018false consciousness\u2019). 19 In addition, Achen and Bartels do not fully specify the mechanisms behind the effects they have discovered, leaving scope for supporters of RI to argue that part of the problem is that important truths are insufficiently well known and that lies go unchallenged. In that case, truth-telling by intellectuals could make a difference to how people vote. What is more, political change does not come about only, or even mainly, through choices at elections, and supporters of RI can argue that the responsibility to tell the truth is partly due to the effect a better-informed public may have in other ways, such as by improving the political culture. The clash between the backfire effect and RI is harder to set aside. Revealing the truth about an issue, political party or candidate may have the opposite result to the one intended, entrenching opinions rather than changing th em. To the extent that RI is motivated or justified by the expectation that exposing political truths will cause positive change, this is a fundamental challenge to the view. H appily, although the backfire effect is robust, there is convergent evidence that information can affect political views in non-perverse ways. \n \n Bounded rationality Both sets of findings have been connected with the fact that human rationality is bounded in various ways: by time, attention span, processing power and the competing demands of life. 20 We are finite beings, with only limited time and resources, and many other things to do besides keeping abre ast of the activities of our governments; so, as Achen and Bartels write, In the welter of political claims and counterclaims, most people simply lack the time and relevant experience to sort out difficult truths from appealing dreams. That is no less true for Ivy League and Oxbridge dons than it is for average citizens. 21 Given that Achen and Bartels\u2019 work does not specify in great detail the mechanisms that are responsible for their results, 22 a proponent of RI could argue that part of the problem is that those who could speak out do not do so, and this increases the amounts of time and attention required to get at the truth by sifting through the lies and evasions of politicians, columnists and the like. As Chomsky noted in his essay: The facts [about the US assault on V ietnam] are known to all who care to know. The press, foreign and domestic, has presented documentation to refute each falsehood as it appe ars. But the power of the government\u2019 s propaganda apparatus is such that the citizen who \n \n does not undertake a research project on the subject can hardly hope to confront government pronouncements with fact. This is work that those with research skills and free time can usefully do, thus lowering t he barriers somewhat for those who do not, although they are left, unavoidably, with the second-order research projects of deciding what to read and whether to believe it. Finding out about and critically reading the work of (e.g.) Patrick Cockburn and Tanya Reinhart on western Asia or Dean Baker and Ha-Joon Chang on economics takes considerable time and effort, but doing the work for oneself would take several lifetimes. 23 The role of the media Most adults get most of their information about politics and current affairs through the mass media. Obviously relevant, therefore, is Chomsky\u2019s work with Edward Herman on the ways that, in the formally free mass media in democratic societies, inconvenient facts are downplayed and debate is bounded by certain presuppositions that are neither questioned nor stated. 24 This work is highly congruent with Achen and Bartels\u2019 work; indeed it can be seen as suggesting mechanisms that help to cause the results they see: By manufacturing consent, you can overcome the fact that formally a lot of people have the right to vote. We can make i t irrelevant because we can manufacture consent and make sure that their choices and \n \n attitudes will be structured in such a way th at they will always do what we tell them, even if they have a formal way to participate. 25 Assuming this is correct, the impact on RI is not obvious. Knowing that certain truths are off limits for the mass media arguably makes it more imperative for those who can to speak out. But this respons ibility comes with a heavy dose of realism about getting views that are outside of the mainstream heard and understood. The role of a good education There are a number of other similarities between the views of Chomsky and Achen and Bartels. Chomsky has frequently made the claim that among the most thoroughly indoctrinated in modern democracies are the \u2018well-educated\u2019, that is, those who have spent longer than average in formal education, especially those who have attended elite institutions: I f you\u2019ve gone to the best schools . .. you just have instilled into you the understanding that there are certain things that [it] wouldn\u2019t do to say [a]nd, it wouldn\u2019t even do to think. 26 In a similar vein, Achen and Bartels write that: W ell-informed citizens[\u2019]... well-organized \u2018ideological\u2019 thinking often turns out to be just a rather mechanical reflection of what their favorite group and party leaders have instructed them to think. 27 \n \n Obviously the picture is complicated by the fact that elite education is also conducive to the possession of s kills that are needed for independent research and to the leisure required to put them to use, as Chomsky pointed out in \u2018The Res ponsibility of Intellectuals\u2019. The role of the democratic system W e\u2019ve seen that Chomsky suggests that the media and the education s ystem structure our attitudes. This could explain some part of Achen and Bartels\u2019 results. But, as discussed above, those results also show that people vote against their own preferences. Their explanation is that voting behaviour is better explained by the social group or groups to which a voter belongs. 28 Another mechanism that very plausibly explains some of the mismatches between voter preferences and policy choices is the role of campaign finance. Thomas Ferguson\u2019 s investment theory of party competition, often cited by Chomsky, postulates that the need to ra ise campaign finance (\u2018the campaign cost condition\u2019) reduces party politics to \u2018competition between blocs of major investors\u2019. 29 This means that voters are offered a choice between organisations that repre sent and will implement the preferred policies of certain areas of business, none of which is likely to match closely the preferences of ordinary voters. As Chomsky has pointed out, for a long time universal healthcare was the preference of the majority of voters in the US, but neither major party offered it. \n \n It would seem that if one takes democracy seriously, one should work towards a system that is resilient against such distortions. Chomsky\u2019 s vision here is of a bottom- up, citizen-led democracy: In a democratic system, what would happen [in the New Hampshire primary] is that the people in New Hampshire would get together in whatever organizations they have: town meetings, churches, unions, and work out what they want policy to be. Then, if some candidate wants to appeal to them, he could ask to be invited, and they would invite him to New Hampshire and tell him what they want. And, if they could get a commitment from him that they could believe in, they might decide to vote for him. That would be a democratic society. 30 Assuming that Achen and Bartels are right, even if important truths become widely known in currently existing democracies, it is entirely possible that there will be little effect on how people vote. That is certainly chastening for supporters of RI, but in itself it is not enough to remove the responsibility, since it does not prove that telling the truth will not have an impact within the present system, and it shows little or nothing about whether it will aid in moving towards a more democratic society. The backfire effect redux If the backfire effect were always operative and dominan t, then a key motivation for telling the truth and exposing lies would disappear, since telling the truth would generally be counterproductive. 31 But a moment\u2019s thought establishes that this cannot \n \n be right. People do change their minds, and at least some of the time when they do so it is because they have been persuaded by evidence against their prior belief. In experimental work investigating the backfire ef fect, Redlawsk, Civettini and Emmerson found that the re is a \u2018tipping point\u2019 beyond whic h further negative evidence has a negative effect rat her than a reinforcing one. 32 As they s ay, this indicates that \u2018voters are not immune to disconfirming information after all, even when initially acting as motivated reasoners\u2019. 33 Other research shows tha t exposure to modest amounts of information can shift opinions considerably and th at it has some e ffect on policy preferences. One strand of this research has focussed on attitudes to immigration. In western countries, most people significantly overestimate the number of immigrants in their country, hold other inaccurate opinions about immigrants and would like immigration reduced. A large study carried out across 13 countries found that telling participants the correct percentage of immigrants in their country made it less likely that they would say that there are too many. In two studies in which participants were told five pieces of information about immigrants, this improved their attitudes toward immigrants. This information did not significantly chang e policy preferences on average, but it did make self-identified right-wingers and Republicans more likely to support pro- immigration policies, the opposite to what one might expect if the backfire effect were operative. 34 Similarly, a recent study carried out by Giovanni Facchin i, Yotam Margalit and Hiroyuki Nakata in Japan \u2013 a country with very few immigrants and broad political opposition to immigration \u2013 found that hostility to increased \n \n immigration was considerably decreased by the presentation of information about potential social and economic benefits. 35 It is clear, therefore, that it can be effective to expose people to information that tends to undermine their beliefs. Obviously, it would be useful to know more about when telling the truth is effective and when it is counterproduc tive. It is very plausible that the way that information is present ed matters, in ways tha t we still know too little about. The research mentioned above on heuristics and biases is obviously relevant. It may also matter whether information is openly stated, or implied, or somehow presupposed. Such questions are the province of pragmatics, the area of linguistics which studies how we communicate with each other in context. 36 There is also a growing literature on the role of the sal ience of social group membership in receptiveness to information and argumentation. 37 As Alana Conner puts it: \u2018One of the things we know from social psychology is when people feel threatened, they can\u2019t change, they can\u2019t listen.\u2019 38 In any case, the respons ibility to tell the truth and expose lies remains, and is accompanied by a responsibility to do so effectively, which implies a further responsibility to keep abreast of research of the type discussed here as it develops. \n \n 1. Of course, telling the truth may be the right thing for intellectuals and others to do for other reasons, for example a Kantian or Christian prohibition on lies, or various possible instrumental roles of truth-telling other than informing people\u2019s first-order political behaviour (e.g. it might promote trust in experts, and that might be a good). I proceed on the assumption that for Chomsky the effect of truth-telling on people\u2019 s political views and therefore behaviour is a central reason for RI. 2.

These findings are congruent with (although logically independent from) Mercier and Sperber\u2019s claim that the evolutionary function of the ability to reason is not to improve knowledge and make better decisions, but to help us to persuade others and to protect us against persuasion. However, to the extent that the results are problematic for RI, that is so regardless of any evolutionary backstory. The issue is what people do when presented with the truth, not why they do it.

The experimental pragmatics literature has extensively investigated the ways in which distinct contextual factors affect the computation of scalar inferences, whose most studied example is the one that allows \u201cSome X-ed\u201d to mean Not all X-ed. Recent studies from Bonnefon et al. (2009, 2011) investigate the effect of politeness on the interpretation of scalar utterances. They argue that when the scalar utterance is face-threatening (\u201cSome people hated your speech\u201d) (i) the scalar inference is less likely to be derived, and (ii) the semantic interpretation of \u201csome\u201d (at least some) is arrived at slowly and effortfully. This paper re-evaluates the role of politeness in the computation of scalar inferences by drawing on the distinction between \u201ccomprehension\u201d and \u201cepistemic assessment\u201d of communicated information. In two experiments, we test the hypothesis that, in these face-threatening contexts, scalar inferences are largely derived but are less likely to be accepted as true. In line with our predictions, we find that slowdowns in the face-threatening condition are attributable to longer reaction times at the (latter) epistemic assessment stage, but not at the comprehension stage. Chris Knight Giovanni Facchini Yotam Margalit Hiroyuki Nakata Is opposition to immigration deeply entrenched or is it open to updating in the face of new information? We explore this question by examining how attitudes of native citizens shift following exposure to information that points to potential upsides of immigration. We do so using a large-scale randomized experiment embedded in a text-comprehension study administered in Japan. As part of the study, participants were subtly presented with information on social and economic problems that immigration could help address (e.g., growing elderly population that requires care, labor shortage in certain sectors). Depending on the treatment, information exposure increased support for a more open immigration policy and motivated pro-immigration political action. Notably, effects persisted 10-12 days after the intervention. The results suggest that information campaigns can lessen public opposition to immigration. Commitment plays a crucial role in the stabilization of communication. While commitment increases the acceptance of the message communicated, it comes with a price: the greater the commitment, the greater the cost (direct or reputational) the speakers incur if the message is found unreliable (Vullioud et al., 2017). This opens up the question of which linguistic cues hearers deploy in order to infer speaker commitment in communication. We present a series of empirical studies to test the hypothesis that distinct meaning-relations e saying, presupposing and implicating e act as pragmatic cues of speaker commitment. Our results demonstrate that, after a message p is found to be false, speakers incur different reputational costs as a function of whether p had been explicitly stated, presupposed, or implicated. All else being equal, participants are significantly more likely to selectively trust the speaker who implicated p than the speaker who asserted or presupposed p. These results provide the first empirical evidence that commitment is modulated by different meaning-relations, and shed a new light on the strategic advantages of implicit communication. Speakers can decrease the reputational damages they incur by conveying unreliable messages when these are implicitly communicated.",

All over India, it was women who embraced the challenge of overcoming numerous social taboos and aesthetic handicaps that came along with this nascent technology. Women who took the plunge and recorded largely belonged to the courtesan community, called _tawaifs_ and _devadasis_, in North and South India, respectively. Recording brought with it great fame, brand recognition, freedom from exploitative patrons, and monetary benefits to the women singers. They were to become pioneers of the music industry in the Indian sub-continent. However, despite the pioneering role played by these women, their stories have largely been forgotten. Contemporaneous with the courtesan women adapting to recording technology was the anti-nautch campaign that sought to abolish these women from the performing space and brand them as common prostitutes. A vigorous renaissance and arts revival movement followed, leading to the creation of a new classical paradigm in both North Indian (Hindustani) and South Indian (Carnatic) classical music. This resulted in the standardization, universalization, and institutionalization of Indian classical music. This newly created classical paradigm impacted future recordings of The Gramophone Company in terms of a shift in genres and styles. Vikram Sampath sheds light on the role and impact of The Gramophone Company\u2019s early recording expeditions on Indian classical music by examining the phenomenon through a sociocultural, historical and musical lens. The book features the indefatigable stories of the women and their experiences in adapting to recording technology. The artists from across India featured are: Gauhar Jaan of Calcutta, Janki Bai of Allahabad, Zohra Bai of Agra, Malka Jaan of Agra, Salem Godavari, Bangalore Nagarathnamma, Coimbatore Thayi, Dhanakoti of Kanchipuram, Bai Sundarabai of Pune, and Husna Jaan of Banaras.\n\n## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n### chapter 1\\|13\u00a0pages\n\n#### [The Exotic East](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/mono/10.4324/9780367822026-1/exotic-east-vikram-sampath?context=ubx&refId=df5b2a40-7a82-4efd-be1f-be058bb9374e)\n\n### chapter 2\\|9\u00a0pages\n\n#### [The Mechanised West](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/mono/10.4324/9780367822026-2/mechanised-west-vikram-sampath?context=ubx&refId=46c3db52-cc54-47cc-9e6f-25fb7566b662)\n\n### chapter 3\\|33\u00a0pages\n\n#### [When the Twain Met](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/mono/10.4324/9780367822026-3/twain-met-vikram-sampath?context=ubx&refId=f309f99d-e232-4406-a99c-853e7ce9bc9d)\n\n### chapter 4\\|29\u00a0pages\n\n#### [The Protagonists\\ \\*](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/mono/10.4324/9780367822026-4/protagonists-vikram-sampath?context=ubx&refId=7f84545f-73e1-4d4f-a990-487576d7faae)\n\n### chapter 5\\|28\u00a0pages\n\n#### [The Abolition and Thereafter](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/mono/10.4324/9780367822026-5/abolition-thereafter-vikram-sampath?context=ubx&refId=47301bf5-a767-4b94-9fb6-1feab36de196)\n\n### chapter 6\\|61\u00a0pages\n\n#### [Analysing the Recordings](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/mono/10.4324/9780367822026-6/analysing-recordings-vikram-sampath?context=ubx&refId=66df1196-42ad-44c4-8602-3d91f44b53d2)\n\n### chapter 7\\|8\u00a0pages\n\n#### [Conclusion](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/mono/10.4324/9780367822026-7/conclusion-vikram-sampath?context=ubx&refId=e40bfdcf-65e3-4c84-baa2-91f6f945dfb1)\n\n[Taylor & Francis Group Logo![Taylor & Francis Group Logo](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/assets/images/tfgroup-logo-white.svg)](https://www.taylorfrancis.com)\n\n- PoliciesPolicies\n\n- [Privacy Policy](https://informa.com/privacy-policy/)\n- [Terms & Conditions](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/terms-and-conditions/)\n- [Cookie Policy](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/cookie-policy/)\n\n- JournalsJournals\n\n- [Taylor & Francis Online](https://www.tandfonline.com)\n\n- CorporateCorporate\n\n- [Taylor & Francis Group](https://taylorandfrancis.com/)\n\n- Help & ContactHelp & Contact\n\n- [Students/Researchers](https://help.taylorfrancis.com/students_researchers)\n- [Librarians/Institutions](https://help.taylorfrancis.com/librarians_institutions)\n\n- Connect with us\n\n\nRegistered in England & Wales No. 3099067\n\n5 Howick Place \\| London \\| SW1P 1WG\u00a9 2024 Informa UK Limited\n\nBack to Top",

The book is available as a free pdf download at https://www.uclpress.co.uk/products/123963 In his famous essay, Chomsky wrote: \u2018It is the responsibility of intellectuals to speak the truth and to expose lies. This, at least, may seem enough of a truism to pass over without comment.\u2019 One might ask what the source of this responsibility (henceforth RI) is. Chomsky notes that in W estern democracies, where there is \u2018political liberty, \u2026 access to information and freedom of expression\u2019 a \u2018privileged minority\u2019 (whom he refers to as \u2018intellectuals\u2019) also have the leisure, the faciliti es, and the training to seek the truth lying hidden behind the veil of distortion and misrepresentation, ideology and class interest, through which the events of current history are presented to us. They therefore have responsibilities that go beyond those of others. Agreeing with this, one might note that RI seems to presuppose that exposing political truths has a certain kind of instrumental value, namely that it will tend to make the world a better place by changing people\u2019 s political views. 1 In fact, Chomsky\u2019 s position on this question is more nuanced. In an interview he said \u2018I don\u2019t have faith that the truth will prevail if it becomes known, but we have no a lternative to \n \n \n proceeding on that assumption\u2019, and he has often endorsed Gramsci\u2019 s \u2018optimism of the will\u2019 as a necessary corollary to pessimism of the intellect. 2 I suggest that intellectuals and other privileged individuals have the responsibility not only to tell the truth and expose lies but to do so in ways that \u2013 in their best judgement \u2013 are most likely to be understood and to be ef fective. This is a fairly direct consequence of another claim that Chomsky has made many times: that people are responsible for the foreseeable consequences of their actions. He calls this a truism, too, with some justification. But why does the issue of effectiveness even arise? Isn\u2019t it enough simply to get the truth out in some form or other? Perhaps no one has ever held such a naive view; in any case, recent findings in psychology and political science make the challenges it faces more obvious and specific. They suggest that the truth does not necessarily influence political behaviour even when it is available, and that exposure to the truth may entrench rather than overthrow erroneous opinions. There is strong evidence th at voting is not driven primarily by evaluation of the policies on offer. Recently, the political scientists Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels have argued that voting is not well explained as selection of a party with policies that match the voter \u2019s preferences, nor as rewarding or punishing incumbents for their ac tions. 3 Evid ence includes the startling fact that votes are strongly affected by natural events. If Achen and Bartels are right, then there is a significant disconnection between widely available information and one of the central ways that citizens exert political power, and it is natural to suppose that the story is similar for \n \n other political behaviour besides voting. The challenge to RI from th is research is that telling the truth and exposing lies may not make much difference. A second problem is indicated by research on motivated reasoning and the \u2018backfire effect\u2019. Facts tha t contradict political beliefs or discredit voters\u2019 preferred electoral candidates tend to reinforce rather than dispel those beliefs and allegiances. 4 We have a strong tendency to treat such facts with suspicion, while uncritically welcoming evidence that confirms our current views. Clearly, the challenge to RI posed by this work is that telling the truth may be counterproductive and damaging. In what follows, I first set out these research findings in a bit more detail, then consider how troubling these results \u2013 if real and robust \u2013are for RI. In my discussion, I briefly show that Achen and Bartels\u2019 results are highly congruent with Chomsky\u2019 s views on the functioning of education systems, the mass media and representative democracy in the US and other modern democracies. It is plausible that deepening democracy so that it more closely matches the popular ideal will require considerable changes to education, the media and the democratic system itself. If the backfire effect is dominant then RI will often be overridden by a responsibility to avoid harm. But the findings about the backfire effect need to be weighed up against other evidence that telling the truth can change opinions in positive ways. The problematic findings Democracy for Realists \n \n In their recen t book, Achen and Bartels claim that there is a dom inant folk theory or popular ideal of democracy, 5 which can be summarised in this way: Ordinary people have preferences about what their government should do. They choose leaders who will do those things, or they enact their preferences directly in referendums. In either case, what the majority wants becomes government policy. 6 Summarising a great deal of evidence, they argue that this theory is wrong: The populist ideal of electoral democracy, for all its elegance and attractiveness, is largely irrelevant in practice, leaving elected officials mostly free to pursue their own notions of the public good or to respond to party and interest group pressures. 7 A wealth of evidence suggests that votes are not cast on the basis of voters\u2019 policy preferences, and unsurprisingly, therefore, there is often a poor match between those preferences and the policies of the parties voted for. 8 Achen and Bartels also argue that electoral choices do not support the retrospective voting hypothesis: that voters assess the performance of elected representatives and officials and punish or reward them accordingly at subsequent elections. They identify two reasons. First, voters are not good at distinguishing the effects caused by government policies from other effects. Achen and Bartels demonstrate this by \n \n showing that voters punish politicians for outcomes that are clearly not under the ir control, including natural events such as shark attacks, droughts and floods. Secondly, voters are not very good at keeping track of changes, even those that impact upon their own welfare. Achen and Bartels show that while voters do vote on the basis of income growth, there is a recency bias: we tend to focus on income growth in the months im mediately prior to the election, neglecting the overall record of the government. They also argue that so-called \u2018direct democracy\u2019, where voters vote on issues rather than for representatives, does not brighten the picture, because there is evidence that the results of such referendums and ballot initiatives reflect campaign spending by the wealthy more than the preferenc es of voters. In practice, Achen and Bartels argue \u2013 agreeing with work by David Broder \u2013 that the result of increased use of direct votes on issues, in the US at least, has largely been to empower the wealthy and well- organised \u2018millionaires and interest groups that use their wealth to achieve their own policy goals\u2019. 9 The true pi cture, Achen and Bartels argue, is that most voters pay little attention to politics, and at elections their choices depend largely on recent developments in the economy and on political group loyalties that are typically held from childhood. 10 The backfire effect A number of studies have found that evidence against a political or social belief may serve to strengthen that belief, and that negative information about a political \n \n candidate may increase the support she receives from those who already support her. Although these findings are striking, they should perhaps not be very surprising, given that ther e is a wealth of evidence from work over several decades in psychology and economics that human reasoning is prone to a wide variety of biases. W e are very far from dispassionate, logical reasoners: our reasoning is often motivated, that is, slanted by our preconceptions and towards conclusions that we would prefer to be true, and much of it is performed by efficient but flawed heuristics rather than processes that respect laws of logic and statistical inference. What is more, we are not very reliable reporters of the way we reason. Introspection \u2013 that is, thinking about how one thinks \u2013 is not in general an ac curate source of information. 11 The work discussed in this section extends this picture to political science. Psychologists Kari Edwards and Edward Smith have shown a disconfirmation bias in reasoning about political and social issues: people examine arguments for longer on average if they clash with a belief that they hold, and such arguments are therefore judged weaker on average than those which are compatible with prior beliefs. They also showed that this bias is greater when the belief that clashes with the argument is held with emotional conviction. 12 In a series of papers, political scientists Milton Lodge and Charles Taber find similar effects in our processing of information rela ting to issues such as gun control and affirmative action. The typical reaction to an argument against a prior belief or commitment is to gene rate counterarguments, whereas arguments that support prior beliefs are accepted uncritically. 13 This tendency to generate counterarguments has a strikingly counterintuitive result: negative information can lead to a strengthening, rather than a weakening, of the \n \n initial belief. 14 This is the \u2018backfire effect\u2019, a term coined by Brendan Nyhan and Jason Reifler. 15 In their study, corrections of erroneous beliefs (e.g. that Iraq poss essed weapons of mass destruction immediately before the US\u2013UK invasion of 2003) led to reinforcement of the false belief. Similar results emerge from work on (simulated) choice of political candidates. A study conduct ed by David Redlawsk found that voters took longer to process information that showed in a bad light a candidate whom the voter had already evaluated positively and information that showed in a good light a candidate already evaluated negatively, compared with information that fitted their expectations. 16 The backfire effect exists here too: negative information about a positively evaluated candidate tended to make that candidate more positively evaluated, not less. In a later paper, Redlawsk and his co- authors Andrew Civettini and Karen Emmerson suggest an explanation: voters committed to a candidate may be motivated to discount incongruent information; they may mentally ar gue against it, bolstering their existing evaluation by recalling all the good things about a liked candidate even in the face of something negative. 17 T aken together, this research suggests that we are very far from ideally rational, disinterested observers of the scene, updating our beliefs as warranted by new evidence. Under certain circumstances, we employ reasoning as a defence mechanism to bolster our prior convictions and choices against inconvenient truths. 18 \n \n Discussion How worried should a supporter of the responsibility of intellectuals be? The Democracy for Realists findings are disturbing, but perhaps not as surprising for those on the left as they have been for some liberals and political scientists, since left- wingers of various persuasions have long argued that many people vote against their own interests (back at least to Engels\u2019 invoc ation of \u2018false consciousness\u2019). 19 In addition, Achen and Bartels do not fully specify the mechanisms behind the effects they have discovered, leaving scope for supporters of RI to argue that part of the problem is that important truths are insufficiently well known and that lies go unchallenged. In that case, truth-telling by intellectuals could make a difference to how people vote. What is more, political change does not come about only, or even mainly, through choices at elections, and supporters of RI can argue that the responsibility to tell the truth is partly due to the effect a better-informed public may have in other ways, such as by improving the political culture. The clash between the backfire effect and RI is harder to set aside. Revealing the truth about an issue, political party or candidate may have the opposite result to the one intended, entrenching opinions rather than changing th em. To the extent that RI is motivated or justified by the expectation that exposing political truths will cause positive change, this is a fundamental challenge to the view. H appily, although the backfire effect is robust, there is convergent evidence that information can affect political views in non-perverse ways. \n \n Bounded rationality Both sets of findings have been connected with the fact that human rationality is bounded in various ways: by time, attention span, processing power and the competing demands of life. 20 We are finite beings, with only limited time and resources, and many other things to do besides keeping abre ast of the activities of our governments; so, as Achen and Bartels write, In the welter of political claims and counterclaims, most people simply lack the time and relevant experience to sort out difficult truths from appealing dreams. That is no less true for Ivy League and Oxbridge dons than it is for average citizens. 21 Given that Achen and Bartels\u2019 work does not specify in great detail the mechanisms that are responsible for their results, 22 a proponent of RI could argue that part of the problem is that those who could speak out do not do so, and this increases the amounts of time and attention required to get at the truth by sifting through the lies and evasions of politicians, columnists and the like. As Chomsky noted in his essay: The facts [about the US assault on V ietnam] are known to all who care to know. The press, foreign and domestic, has presented documentation to refute each falsehood as it appe ars. But the power of the government\u2019 s propaganda apparatus is such that the citizen who \n \n does not undertake a research project on the subject can hardly hope to confront government pronouncements with fact. This is work that those with research skills and free time can usefully do, thus lowering t he barriers somewhat for those who do not, although they are left, unavoidably, with the second-order research projects of deciding what to read and whether to believe it. Finding out about and critically reading the work of (e.g.) Patrick Cockburn and Tanya Reinhart on western Asia or Dean Baker and Ha-Joon Chang on economics takes considerable time and effort, but doing the work for oneself would take several lifetimes. 23 The role of the media Most adults get most of their information about politics and current affairs through the mass media. Obviously relevant, therefore, is Chomsky\u2019s work with Edward Herman on the ways that, in the formally free mass media in democratic societies, inconvenient facts are downplayed and debate is bounded by certain presuppositions that are neither questioned nor stated. 24 This work is highly congruent with Achen and Bartels\u2019 work; indeed it can be seen as suggesting mechanisms that help to cause the results they see: By manufacturing consent, you can overcome the fact that formally a lot of people have the right to vote. We can make i t irrelevant because we can manufacture consent and make sure that their choices and \n \n attitudes will be structured in such a way th at they will always do what we tell them, even if they have a formal way to participate. 25 Assuming this is correct, the impact on RI is not obvious. Knowing that certain truths are off limits for the mass media arguably makes it more imperative for those who can to speak out. But this respons ibility comes with a heavy dose of realism about getting views that are outside of the mainstream heard and understood. The role of a good education There are a number of other similarities between the views of Chomsky and Achen and Bartels. Chomsky has frequently made the claim that among the most thoroughly indoctrinated in modern democracies are the \u2018well-educated\u2019, that is, those who have spent longer than average in formal education, especially those who have attended elite institutions: I f you\u2019ve gone to the best schools . .. you just have instilled into you the understanding that there are certain things that [it] wouldn\u2019t do to say [a]nd, it wouldn\u2019t even do to think. 26 In a similar vein, Achen and Bartels write that: W ell-informed citizens[\u2019]... well-organized \u2018ideological\u2019 thinking often turns out to be just a rather mechanical reflection of what their favorite group and party leaders have instructed them to think. 27 \n \n Obviously the picture is complicated by the fact that elite education is also conducive to the possession of s kills that are needed for independent research and to the leisure required to put them to use, as Chomsky pointed out in \u2018The Res ponsibility of Intellectuals\u2019. The role of the democratic system W e\u2019ve seen that Chomsky suggests that the media and the education s ystem structure our attitudes. This could explain some part of Achen and Bartels\u2019 results. But, as discussed above, those results also show that people vote against their own preferences. Their explanation is that voting behaviour is better explained by the social group or groups to which a voter belongs. 28 Another mechanism that very plausibly explains some of the mismatches between voter preferences and policy choices is the role of campaign finance. Thomas Ferguson\u2019 s investment theory of party competition, often cited by Chomsky, postulates that the need to ra ise campaign finance (\u2018the campaign cost condition\u2019) reduces party politics to \u2018competition between blocs of major investors\u2019. 29 This means that voters are offered a choice between organisations that repre sent and will implement the preferred policies of certain areas of business, none of which is likely to match closely the preferences of ordinary voters. As Chomsky has pointed out, for a long time universal healthcare was the preference of the majority of voters in the US, but neither major party offered it. \n \n It would seem that if one takes democracy seriously, one should work towards a system that is resilient against such distortions. Chomsky\u2019 s vision here is of a bottom- up, citizen-led democracy: In a democratic system, what would happen [in the New Hampshire primary] is that the people in New Hampshire would get together in whatever organizations they have: town meetings, churches, unions, and work out what they want policy to be. Then, if some candidate wants to appeal to them, he could ask to be invited, and they would invite him to New Hampshire and tell him what they want. And, if they could get a commitment from him that they could believe in, they might decide to vote for him. That would be a democratic society. 30 Assuming that Achen and Bartels are right, even if important truths become widely known in currently existing democracies, it is entirely possible that there will be little effect on how people vote. That is certainly chastening for supporters of RI, but in itself it is not enough to remove the responsibility, since it does not prove that telling the truth will not have an impact within the present system, and it shows little or nothing about whether it will aid in moving towards a more democratic society. The backfire effect redux If the backfire effect were always operative and dominan t, then a key motivation for telling the truth and exposing lies would disappear, since telling the truth would generally be counterproductive. 31 But a moment\u2019s thought establishes that this cannot \n \n be right. People do change their minds, and at least some of the time when they do so it is because they have been persuaded by evidence against their prior belief. In experimental work investigating the backfire ef fect, Redlawsk, Civettini and Emmerson found that the re is a \u2018tipping point\u2019 beyond whic h further negative evidence has a negative effect rat her than a reinforcing one. 32 As they s ay, this indicates that \u2018voters are not immune to disconfirming information after all, even when initially acting as motivated reasoners\u2019. 33 Other research shows tha t exposure to modest amounts of information can shift opinions considerably and th at it has some e ffect on policy preferences. One strand of this research has focussed on attitudes to immigration. In western countries, most people significantly overestimate the number of immigrants in their country, hold other inaccurate opinions about immigrants and would like immigration reduced. A large study carried out across 13 countries found that telling participants the correct percentage of immigrants in their country made it less likely that they would say that there are too many. In two studies in which participants were told five pieces of information about immigrants, this improved their attitudes toward immigrants. This information did not significantly chang e policy preferences on average, but it did make self-identified right-wingers and Republicans more likely to support pro- immigration policies, the opposite to what one might expect if the backfire effect were operative. 34 Similarly, a recent study carried out by Giovanni Facchin i, Yotam Margalit and Hiroyuki Nakata in Japan \u2013 a country with very few immigrants and broad political opposition to immigration \u2013 found that hostility to increased \n \n immigration was considerably decreased by the presentation of information about potential social and economic benefits. 35 It is clear, therefore, that it can be effective to expose people to information that tends to undermine their beliefs. Obviously, it would be useful to know more about when telling the truth is effective and when it is counterproduc tive. It is very plausible that the way that information is present ed matters, in ways tha t we still know too little about. The research mentioned above on heuristics and biases is obviously relevant. It may also matter whether information is openly stated, or implied, or somehow presupposed. Such questions are the province of pragmatics, the area of linguistics which studies how we communicate with each other in context. 36 There is also a growing literature on the role of the sal ience of social group membership in receptiveness to information and argumentation. 37 As Alana Conner puts it: \u2018One of the things we know from social psychology is when people feel threatened, they can\u2019t change, they can\u2019t listen.\u2019 38 In any case, the respons ibility to tell the truth and expose lies remains, and is accompanied by a responsibility to do so effectively, which implies a further responsibility to keep abreast of research of the type discussed here as it develops. \n \n 1. Of course, telling the truth may be the right thing for intellectuals and others to do for other reasons, for example a Kantian or Christian prohibition on lies, or various possible instrumental roles of truth-telling other than informing people\u2019s first-order political behaviour (e.g. it might promote trust in experts, and that might be a good). I proceed on the assumption that for Chomsky the effect of truth-telling on people\u2019 s political views and therefore behaviour is a central reason for RI. 2.

These findings are congruent with (although logically independent from) Mercier and Sperber\u2019s claim that the evolutionary function of the ability to reason is not to improve knowledge and make better decisions, but to help us to persuade others and to protect us against persuasion. However, to the extent that the results are problematic for RI, that is so regardless of any evolutionary backstory. The issue is what people do when presented with the truth, not why they do it.

While acknowledging this funding, Chomsky has always denied that it had any effect on either his linguistics or his political activism. Here, I provide evidence that Chomsky\u2019s linguistic theories were initially developed in a context of significant military interest and involvement. I go on to argue that Chomsky\u2019s anti-militarist conscience then prompted him to throw himself into passionate resistance against the Vietnam War \u2013 while making sure that his models of language were so abstract and unrealistic that military applications were unlikely ever to be found. The result was an impoverished linguistics that ignores the political implications of our understanding of language and its origins.

The experimental pragmatics literature has extensively investigated the ways in which distinct contextual factors affect the computation of scalar inferences, whose most studied example is the one that allows \u201cSome X-ed\u201d to mean Not all X-ed. Recent studies from Bonnefon et al. (2009, 2011) investigate the effect of politeness on the interpretation of scalar utterances. They argue that when the scalar utterance is face-threatening (\u201cSome people hated your speech\u201d) (i) the scalar inference is less likely to be derived, and (ii) the semantic interpretation of \u201csome\u201d (at least some) is arrived at slowly and effortfully. This paper re-evaluates the role of politeness in the computation of scalar inferences by drawing on the distinction between \u201ccomprehension\u201d and \u201cepistemic assessment\u201d of communicated information. In two experiments, we test the hypothesis that, in these face-threatening contexts, scalar inferences are largely derived but are less likely to be accepted as true. In line with our predictions, we find that slowdowns in the face-threatening condition are attributable to longer reaction times at the (latter) epistemic assessment stage, but not at the comprehension stage. Chris Knight Giovanni Facchini Yotam Margalit Hiroyuki Nakata Is opposition to immigration deeply entrenched or is it open to updating in the face of new information? We explore this question by examining how attitudes of native citizens shift following exposure to information that points to potential upsides of immigration. We do so using a large-scale randomized experiment embedded in a text-comprehension study administered in Japan. As part of the study, participants were subtly presented with information on social and economic problems that immigration could help address (e.g., growing elderly population that requires care, labor shortage in certain sectors). Depending on the treatment, information exposure increased support for a more open immigration policy and motivated pro-immigration political action. Notably, effects persisted 10-12 days after the intervention. The results suggest that information campaigns can lessen public opposition to immigration. Commitment plays a crucial role in the stabilization of communication. While commitment increases the acceptance of the message communicated, it comes with a price: the greater the commitment, the greater the cost (direct or reputational) the speakers incur if the message is found unreliable (Vullioud et al., 2017). This opens up the question of which linguistic cues hearers deploy in order to infer speaker commitment in communication. We present a series of empirical studies to test the hypothesis that distinct meaning-relations e saying, presupposing and implicating e act as pragmatic cues of speaker commitment. Our results demonstrate that, after a message p is found to be false, speakers incur different reputational costs as a function of whether p had been explicitly stated, presupposed, or implicated. All else being equal, participants are significantly more likely to selectively trust the speaker who implicated p than the speaker who asserted or presupposed p. These results provide the first empirical evidence that commitment is modulated by different meaning-relations, and shed a new light on the strategic advantages of implicit communication. Speakers can decrease the reputational damages they incur by conveying unreliable messages when these are implicitly communicated.",

All over India, it was women who embraced the challenge of overcoming numerous social taboos and aesthetic handicaps that came along with this nascent technology. Women who took the plunge and recorded largely belonged to the courtesan community, called _tawaifs_ and _devadasis_, in North and South India, respectively. Recording brought with it great fame, brand recognition, freedom from exploitative patrons, and monetary benefits to the women singers. They were to become pioneers of the music industry in the Indian sub-continent. However, despite the pioneering role played by these women, their stories have largely been forgotten. Contemporaneous with the courtesan women adapting to recording technology was the anti-nautch campaign that sought to abolish these women from the performing space and brand them as common prostitutes. A vigorous renaissance and arts revival movement followed, leading to the creation of a new classical paradigm in both North Indian (Hindustani) and South Indian (Carnatic) classical music. This resulted in the standardization, universalization, and institutionalization of Indian classical music. This newly created classical paradigm impacted future recordings of The Gramophone Company in terms of a shift in genres and styles. Vikram Sampath sheds light on the role and impact of The Gramophone Company\u2019s early recording expeditions on Indian classical music by examining the phenomenon through a sociocultural, historical and musical lens. The book features the indefatigable stories of the women and their experiences in adapting to recording technology. The artists from across India featured are: Gauhar Jaan of Calcutta, Janki Bai of Allahabad, Zohra Bai of Agra, Malka Jaan of Agra, Salem Godavari, Bangalore Nagarathnamma, Coimbatore Thayi, Dhanakoti of Kanchipuram, Bai Sundarabai of Pune, and Husna Jaan of Banaras.\n\n## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n### chapter 1\\|13\u00a0pages\n\n#### [The Exotic East](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/mono/10.4324/9780367822026-1/exotic-east-vikram-sampath?context=ubx&refId=df5b2a40-7a82-4efd-be1f-be058bb9374e)\n\n### chapter 2\\|9\u00a0pages\n\n#### [The Mechanised West](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/mono/10.4324/9780367822026-2/mechanised-west-vikram-sampath?context=ubx&refId=46c3db52-cc54-47cc-9e6f-25fb7566b662)\n\n### chapter 3\\|33\u00a0pages\n\n#### [When the Twain Met](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/mono/10.4324/9780367822026-3/twain-met-vikram-sampath?context=ubx&refId=f309f99d-e232-4406-a99c-853e7ce9bc9d)\n\n### chapter 4\\|29\u00a0pages\n\n#### [The Protagonists\\ \\*](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/mono/10.4324/9780367822026-4/protagonists-vikram-sampath?context=ubx&refId=7f84545f-73e1-4d4f-a990-487576d7faae)\n\n### chapter 5\\|28\u00a0pages\n\n#### [The Abolition and Thereafter](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/mono/10.4324/9780367822026-5/abolition-thereafter-vikram-sampath?context=ubx&refId=47301bf5-a767-4b94-9fb6-1feab36de196)\n\n### chapter 6\\|61\u00a0pages\n\n#### [Analysing the Recordings](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/mono/10.4324/9780367822026-6/analysing-recordings-vikram-sampath?context=ubx&refId=66df1196-42ad-44c4-8602-3d91f44b53d2)\n\n### chapter 7\\|8\u00a0pages\n\n#### [Conclusion](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/mono/10.4324/9780367822026-7/conclusion-vikram-sampath?context=ubx&refId=e40bfdcf-65e3-4c84-baa2-91f6f945dfb1)\n\n[Taylor & Francis Group Logo![Taylor & Francis Group Logo](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/assets/images/tfgroup-logo-white.svg)](https://www.taylorfrancis.com)\n\n- PoliciesPolicies\n\n- [Privacy Policy](https://informa.com/privacy-policy/)\n- [Terms & Conditions](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/terms-and-conditions/)\n- [Cookie Policy](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/cookie-policy/)\n\n- JournalsJournals\n\n- [Taylor & Francis Online](https://www.tandfonline.com)\n\n- CorporateCorporate\n\n- [Taylor & Francis Group](https://taylorandfrancis.com/)\n\n- Help & ContactHelp & Contact\n\n- [Students/Researchers](https://help.taylorfrancis.com/students_researchers)\n- [Librarians/Institutions](https://help.taylorfrancis.com/librarians_institutions)\n\n- Connect with us\n\n\nRegistered in England & Wales No. 3099067\n\n5 Howick Place \\| London \\| SW1P 1WG\u00a9 2024 Informa UK Limited\n\nBack to Top",
