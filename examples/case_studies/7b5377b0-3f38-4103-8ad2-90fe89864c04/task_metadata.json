        "Steps": "1. Googled Venezuelan Declaration of Independence, found it to be in 1811, thus L = 11\n2. Googled TikTok logo, found 4 colors, 2 of which are black and white, so A = 2\n3. Googled average height of woman in Philippines, found it to be 149.6cm, so C = 150\n4. Deciphered formula to mean 11x = (d/dx(2x^2)) + 4097 - 150\n5. Used simple calculus and algebra to solve the equation",
