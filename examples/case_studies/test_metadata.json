You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.\n\nIn the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of \u0218irnea.

The dice settle into a 4\u00d74 tray so that only the top letter of each cube is visible. After they have settled into the tray, a three-minute sand timer is started and all players simultaneously begin the main phase of play.[3]\n\nEach player searches for words that fit the following criteria:\n\nWords must be at least three letters in length.\nEach letter after the first must be a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal neighbor of the one before it.\nNo individual letter cube may be used more than once in a word.\nNo capitalized or hyphenated words are allowed.\nMultiple forms of the same word are allowed, such as singular/plural forms and other derivations. Each player records all the words they find by writing on a private sheet of paper. After three minutes have elapsed, all players must immediately stop writing and the game enters the scoring phase.\n\nIn this, each player reads off their list of discovered words. If two or more players wrote the same word, it is removed from all players' lists. Any player may challenge the validity of a word, in which case a previously nominated dictionary is used to verify or refute it. Once all duplicates and invalid words have been eliminated, points are awarded based on the length of each remaining word in a player's list. The winner is the player whose point total is highest, with any ties typically broken by a count of long words.\"\n\nStep 5: Using a web browser, navigate to the nominated dictionary specified by my user, https://github.com/dwyl/english-words\nStep 6: Navigate to the linked page, https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_alpha.txt\nStep 7: Download the words_alpha.txt dictionary and save it to my file system as \"words_alpha.txt\"\nStep 8: Using a Python IDE, create a new project to solve the user's request as specified\nStep 9: Compose a Python program that accepts an input string and prints an output of all words that can be generated that match words in the nominated dictionary. The program must observe the rules discovered in Step 4.
